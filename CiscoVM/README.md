### How it works
Forescout Cisco VM App exports endpoints' data to Cisco Vulnerability Management REST API.
The app contains Policy template that controls the export process by applying Export or Reset actions.

#### Export flow
1. By default, the policy exports data only for new endpoints or endpoints that were changed from the last export. 
By default, the recheck for the changed endpoints happens every day at 12 AM (Forescout Appliance time zone).  
2. If export for an endpoint fails, the app retries an export in 10 minutes. If the export fails again, the app attempts to reexport every 2 hours.
3. In case the endpoint doesn't have any changes for the exported properties for 1 month, it's reexported.
4. Endpoints that have Exported and Unchanged state are also following a daily recheck schedule. They are not moved to the Pending state before the recheck to avoid redundant execution of the Reset action.

### Configuration
Before starting the configuration process, Forescout connector must be created in Cisco Vulnerability Management UI.
The connector generates configuration parameters that are required to configure Cisco VM eyeExtend Connect app.

#### Configure App
Parameters required during the configuration process:
* URL - URL of Cisco VM Webhook which saves the exported data to Cisco VM environment
* UID - a unique identifier defined per client per connector
* AUTH Token - Token for Cisco VM REST API

#### Apply policy
The policy must be added manually after the app is imported and configured.
1. Go to ForeScout Policy tab -> Add -> "Cisco VM" policy template group -> "Cisco VM Export" template
2. Follow configuration instructions. The user must set IP range of endpoints that should be exported. Other configuration steps are optional as the template includes default configuration.
